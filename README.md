# 📰 Simple Newspaper Website - HTML Only

Welcome! This is a minimalist newspaper website created purely with HTML. No CSS, no JavaScript—just good old HTML. This was one of my first projects during my internship when I was learning the fundamentals of web development.

## 📝 Project Overview

Ever wondered what a website built with *only HTML* would look like? Here’s my take on a simple newspaper site without any bells and whistles—just clean, straightforward content and structure. The goal was to capture the essence of a classic newspaper layout, using nothing more than HTML.

### 🌐 Features

This project includes essential features, all made accessible through HTML alone:

- **Structured Content**: Each section of the newspaper has its own HTML page for a streamlined and focused browsing experience.
- **Consistent Layout**: Simple and clear navigation, allowing users to move easily between sections.
- **Basic Navigation Bar**: The main menu links to each section for a straightforward, no-fuss user journey.

### 📂 Project Structure

The project files are organized as follows:

- `Home page.html` - A simple webpage where news headlines are displayed
- `About us.html`- A simple about us page
- `contact.html` - A simple contact page to reach out.

Each file contains only HTML, with a consistent structure across all pages.

### 💻 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

### 🔧 HTML Elements

This project utilizes classic HTML tags to create a structured layout, including:

- `<header>` and `<footer>`: To create a consistent frame around the content.
- `<nav>`: Main navigation for easy movement between sections.
- `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`: Used to organize content, much like a traditional newspaper.
- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and beyond: Headline tags to maintain a clear hierarchy.
- `<a>`: Links between pages for seamless navigation.

### 📅 Future Enhancements

While this project is HTML-only, I look forward to enhancing it with:

- **CSS Styling**: Adding fonts, colors, and layouts to modernize the look.
- **Responsive Design**: Making it adaptable for different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript**: Bringing interactivity, like live updates or a news ticker.
